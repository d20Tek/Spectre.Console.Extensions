* Added unit tests for new functions.

## Release v1.50.1
* Split off non-Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection frameworks to a separate package: D20Tek.Spectre.Console.Extensions.MoreContainers.

## Release v1.2.10
* Updated to target .NET 9.

* Upgraded to latest Spectre.Console

## Release v1.0.7
* Implemented CommandAppTestContext to simplify running individual commands within the CommandApp infrastructure.
* Implemented CommandAppBuilderTestContext to simplify running commands for apps that are based on the CommandAppBuilder pattern.
* Implemented CommandConfigurationTestContext to validate your CommandApp's configuration matches what you expect.
* Implemented CommandAppE2ERunner to run the Main method of any command-line app with specified arguments.
* Several helper classes (TestConsole, CommandMetadata, FakeCommandConfigurator, etc) to assist in testing and validation.

## Release v1.0.6
* Added optional parameter to all With*Container extension methods to allow container to be passed to CommandAppBuilder.
* If no optional container passed, we still create a new instance of the appropriate container.
* New unit tests to validate providing optional containers.

## Release v1.0.5

* Extension method unit tests.
* Sample project for Autofac integration.
* Implemented LightInject type registrar and resolver with unit tests.
* Implement CommandAppBuilder extension method for LightInject with unit test.
* Sample project for LightInject integration.

## Release v1.0.3
* Implemented SimpleInjector type registrar and resolver with unit tests.
* Created sample console project for SimpleInjector integration.
* Created CommandAppBuilder as new mechanism for creating, configuring, and running Spectre.Console CommandApps.
* Migrated all sample apps from DI factories to the new builder pattern.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removed DI framework specific factory classes and old StartupBase&lt;T&gt; class.
* Added WithDefaultCommand method to replace Build&lt;T&gt; method... remove duplicate Build methods.
